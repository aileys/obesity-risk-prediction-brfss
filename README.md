# Obesity Risk Prediction using BRFSS Health Data

This project builds a machine learning model to predict obesity risk using demographic, lifestyle, and behavioral health features based on the CDC BRFSS dataset. Completed as part of the I310D Human-Centered Data Science course at The University of Texas at Austin.
