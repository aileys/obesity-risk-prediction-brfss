# Obesity Risk Prediction Using Logistic Regression  
### Public Health Data Analysis with BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System)

This project applies **logistic regression** to predict **obesity risk** using a subset of the CDC's BRFSS dataset. The analysis explores demographic, behavioral, and health-related factors to understand how lifestyle variables influence obesity outcomes.  

This work was completed as part of my **Human-Centered Data Science course (I310D)** at The University of Texas at Austin, with a focus on ethical data handling, statistical modeling, and interpretability.

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Build a **binary classification model** predicting obesity status  
- Perform **data cleaning, feature selection, and preprocessing**  
- Visualize obesity-related patterns in demographic and behavioral variables  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation  
- Interpret which factors most influence obesity likelihood
